# Coffee-House-Website-Backend
This is the backend of a fully functional FullStack e-commerce site with stripe for payments. The backend server mainly handles the stripe payments and email
notifications with nodemailer.
It's a pretty simple full stack e-commerce site though, so no data base yet. I might add one later.
